  <h1>What I like To Do</h1> 
  <h2>Sleeping</h2> 
  <p>I like sleeping because it is a good way to waste my time, and I really don't like getting up</p> 
  <p>Every morning now, my dad comes in to wake me up and I get really annoyed</p> 
  <h1>Pillows</h1> 
  <p>I only like my pillow, and I don't sleep as well if I'm not using my pillow</p> 
  <h2>White vs. Dots</h2> 
  <p>A while ago my mother changed the sheets of my bed from white sheets to polka dotted sheets and now I don't like my bed as much</p>
